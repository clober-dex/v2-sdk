# @clober/v2-sdk

The Clober V2 SDK provides abstractions to assist you with interacting with the [Clober V2 smart contracts](https://github.com/clober-dex/v2-core) in a Typescript/Javascript environment (e.g. websites, node scripts). 

It makes uses of the Core SDK to gain access to abstractions that are common amongst the Clober SDKs. 

To begin, we recommend looking at our Guides which include [runnable examples](https://github.com/clober-dex/v2-sdk/tree/main/examples) and walkthroughs of core usages. These guides will help you better understand how to use the SDK and integrate it into your application.
